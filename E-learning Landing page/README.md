## My process

Firstly I began with developing the mobile view and then proceeded to work on the tablet and desktop view. I found positioning the title image difficult in the tablet and desktop view.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I figured out that an easy way to position elements is to set the parent element's position to relative and then position the child element relatively. I also learnt about the object-fit and object-position css properties.
